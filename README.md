# AR Plant Showcase App

## Introduction

This project focuses on the development of an Augmented Reality (AR) application utilizing Unity's capabilities. The primary goal is to showcase a diverse range of decorative plants in an engaging and informative manner.

## Use Case

### Efficient Space Utilization

The application contributes to efficient space utilization by visually representing how plants will occupy designated areas. This feature assists businesses in making informed decisions about their interior design.

### Cost-effective Planning

Businesses can optimize their plant investments by estimating the number and types of plants required. This approach helps in avoiding unnecessary expenses, ensuring a cost-effective yet visually appealing interior design.

### Enhanced User Experience

The interactive and visual nature of the app enhances the user experience during the planning phase. It fosters creativity and collaboration among stakeholders involved in the interior design process.

### Time-saving Design Process

The AR app expedites the design process by allowing users to experiment with different plant arrangements virtually. This saves time compared to traditional trial-and-error methods.

## Functionalities

The app detects a plane from the camera input and highlights it with black borders. When the user taps inside the detected plane, the app virtually places the selected plant in the designated location within the AR space.

## Compatibility

This app is compatible with any Android device running Android version 7.0 and above.
